          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces a key challenge in effectively
            representing and reasoning about knowledge, especially when dealing
            with exceptions and uncertainties. Traditional reasoning methods
            based on classical logic often fall short, as they do not
            accommodate the complexities of real-world scenarios. Defeasible
            reasoning, particularly through the KLM framework, offers a solution
            by allowing conclusions to be retracted in light of new information,
            thereby providing a more flexible approach to AI decision-making.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px">
            Our project addresses the limited availability of defeasible
            knowledge base generators and practical implementations of rational
            closure, the most prominent defeasible reasoning framework. We aim
            to contribute to this research by developing reasoners that
            implement both <strong>rational closure</strong> and its extension,
            <strong>lexicographic closure</strong>, with step-by-step
            explanations to provide transparency in the reasoning process.
            Additionally, we focus on optimizing knowledge base generation and
            improving the practical implementations of rational closure to make
            them more scalable and efficient.

              <h4>Propositional Logic</h4>
              <p>
                Propositional logic is introduced as the formal system to reason
                about atomic propositions. Boolean operators like AND, OR, and
                NOT are used to combine propositions, with rules of precedence
                for evaluating logical expressions. The semantics of
                propositional logic are discussed through interpretations (truth
                assignments) and the concept of satisfaction and models of
                formulas. Entailment is the notion that using the relationship
                between two or more statements one can make deductions or
                conclusions . This is a fundamental concept in reasoning, it
                formally shows how certain states of the world are logical
                consequence of others.

              <h4>Defeasible Reasoning</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Defeasible reasoning</strong> is a type of reasoning
                where conclusions are drawn from incomplete or uncertain
                information and can be revised when new information arises.
                Unlike classical reasoning, where conclusions are fixed once
                drawn, defeasible reasoning allows conclusions to remain
                tentative and be overridden by exceptions or additional data.
                This makes it particularly useful for modeling real-world
                situations where certainty is often limited.

              <h4>KLM Framework</h4>
              <p>
                The KLM framework formalizes defeasible reasoning using
                conditional assertions, allowing for typical implications rather
                than strict logical conclusions. For example, the assertion
                "birds typically fly" can accommodate exceptions like "penguins
                typically don’t fly." The framework outlines several rationality
                properties, such as reflexivity, left logical equivalence, and
                rational monotonicity, to ensure that entailments are rational.
                Preferential and ranked interpretations are used to model
                defeasible entailments, where more typical scenarios are ranked
                lower and are preferred.

              <h4>Rational Closure</h4>
              <p>
                Rational closure is a method for making inferences from
                defeasible knowledge while ensuring logical consistency. It
                ranks knowledge based on typicality and ensures that conclusions
                drawn respect rationality. It is the most conservative form of
                defeasible entailment, ensuring that anything entailed by
                rational closure will also be entailed by other forms of
                defeasible reasoning. The
                <strong>Base Rank Algorithm</strong> separates knowledge into
                ranks, where the more exceptional statements are ranked higher.
                The <strong>Rational Closure Algorithm</strong>
                then checks for defeasible implications by evaluating the ranks.

              <h4>Lexicographic Closure</h4>
              <p>
                Lexicographic closure builds on rational closure by refining it
                to consider both the cardinality and specificity of statements.
                It ensures that more specific rules are given priority, and less
                serious violations are preferred over more serious ones. This
                form of closure weakens specific formulas rather than discarding
                entire levels when inconsistencies are found, allowing for more
                nuanced reasoning.

          <h2>Knowledge Base Generation</h2>
          <p>
            The main objectives of this knowledge base component of the project
            were to create a pseudo-random, multi-threaded defeasible knowledge
            base generator for testing the rational closure algorithm and its
            extensions. The project also focused on optimizing the generator
            through parallel programming improvements, reusing existing
            knowledge bases to leverage the space-time trade-off, and enhancing
            the overall architecture. Additionally, it aimed to increase the
            expressiveness of generated knowledge bases and analyze key
            parameters affecting the generation process. Overall, the goal was
            to bridge the gap in platforms available for testing and developing
            reasoners. The generator’s performance was shaped by a set of
            <bold>control parameters</bold>, detailed in the following section.

            <p>
              The optimized knowledge base generator (KBG_Optimized)
              significantly reduced generation time compared to the original KBG
              under the same control parameters. Testing across 10 different
              defeasible knowledge bases, all with varying ranks, statements,
              and complexities, showed a 100% accuracy rate with no errors. In
              the space-time trade-off test, it was found that using existing
              knowledge bases for generation reduces time but increases storage
              requirements. Parameter analysis revealed weak correlations
              between individual parameters and generation time, with complexity
              and reuse of consequents being key factors. Further Monte Carlo
              simulations showed stronger correlations with certain
              distributions, like linear decline and exponential growth,
              affecting generation time, while flat and random distributions had
              weaker correlations.

            <p>
              In future work, I recommend developing non-deterministic knowledge
              bases based on specific contexts or languages, such as English.
              This would involve understanding language concepts and translating
              them into propositional statements and connectives. A defeasible
              knowledge base generator of this kind could create more realistic
              world representations, improving reasoners suited to specific
              environments. Additionally, implementing a propositional formula
              formatting feature in the generator would allow for more precise
              testing of reasoners, by specifying the desired formula format
              rather than just selecting connectives and complexity levels.

          <p>
            Traditional reasoning methods based on classical logic often fall
            short, as they do not accommodate the complexities of real-world
            scenarios. Defeasible reasoning, particularly through the KLM
            framework, offers a solution by allowing conclusions to be retracted
            in light of new information, thereby providing a more flexible
            approach to AI decision-making.

            Despite the theoretical advancements in rational closure, there have
            been few practical implementations, leaving a significant gap in
            research. Moreover, rational closure is inherently not well-suited
            for large knowledge bases due to its linear nature, which makes the
            process inefficient and unscalable. Given the increasing complexity
            of real-world AI applications, optimizing rational closure to handle
            large knowledge bases efficiently is crucial. This paper addresses
            these issues by exploring optimization techniques, such as caching
            and advanced search algorithms, to enhance the scalability of
            rational closure, making it applicable to larger, more complex
            systems.

              <h3>Aims</h3>
              <p>
                The primary goal of this research is to optimize the Rational
                Closure algorithm for defeasible reasoning. We aim to evaluate
                the effects of caching and search algorithms (binary and ternary
                searches) on the algorithm’s performance. By improving the
                scalability and efficiency of Rational Closure, we hope to
                extend its practical applicability, particularly in systems that
                handle large knowledge bases and complex queries.

              <h3>Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                We developed six different defeasible reasoners, including
                naive, binary, and ternary entailment checkers. These reasoners
                were built on the foundational work of previous researchers and
                employed the Sat4j solver for satisfiability checks. The binary
                and ternary reasoners utilize search algorithms to optimize the
                ranking process, while caching mechanisms were introduced to
                minimize redundant calculations. The research also introduced
                two caching strategies: antecedent-based caching, which stores
                and reuses ranks associated with queries, and full-query
                caching, which stores entire query results for repeated use.

                The experimental results showed that both binary and ternary
                search methods consistently outperformed the naive
                implementation in terms of execution time, regardless of the
                size of the knowledge base. Below is a graph illustrating the
                comparison of execution times.

                Future research could explore the conditions under which ternary
                search outperforms binary, particularly in complex knowledge
                bases with irregular rank distributions. Additionally, further
                investigation into optimizing cache management for larger and
                more dynamic query sets would be beneficial. Exploring advanced
                query patterns and scaling to even larger knowledge bases will
                be essential to improving the practical applicability of
                Rational Closure in real-world AI systems.

              This project developed a web-based tool designed to showcase
              defeasible reasoning processes, specifically focusing on Rational
              Closure and Lexicographic Closure. The application allows users to
              input knowledge bases and queries, displaying the reasoning steps.
              The software, built with
              <strong>Java</strong> (back-end) and
              <strong>TypeScript/ReactJS</strong>
              (front-end), implements algorithms for defeasible entailment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The back-end system employs the Javalin framework to create
              RESTful APIs, enabling interaction between the front-end and core
              reasoning algorithms, which leverage the

              library. The tool computes Base Rank, Rational Closure, and
              Lexicographic Closure algorithms and displays results in a
              structured manner, aiding in understanding how conclusions are
              derived.

              This tool allows users to edit defeasible implication, edit the
              knowledge base and upload the knowledge base from a text file. The
              user can compute defeasible entailment. The formulas in this tool
              are entered as plain text but displayed as Math formulas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>Summary</strong> section shows the entailment results,
              initial ranking, final rankings and the time taken to compute
              algorithms. The <strong>Base Rank</strong> sections shows a
              step-by-step process on how to construct initial ranking from a
              given knowledge base. The
              <strong>Rational Closure</strong> section shows a step-by-step
              process starting with initial ranking, to removing ranks and
              getting the entailment results. The
              <strong>Lexicographic Closure</strong> section shows a
              step-by-step process starting with initial ranking, weaking ranks,
              removing ranks, and getting the entailment results.
            </p>

            <p>
              This web tool demonstrates the defeasible reasoning process and
              serves as a debugger for identifying exceptional knowledge base
              statements. Future work could focus on extending the software to
              handle other forms of defeasible entailment, such as Relevant
              Closure, and on adding optimized entailment algorithms to the
              tool.
